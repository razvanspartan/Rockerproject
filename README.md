### VERY IMPORTANT PLEASE READ
Hello, first off I want to thank you for checking out my project now let me clear some things off:
## 1. This project uses javaFx make sure you have it install if you want to run this project
## 2. Some values might be different than what you expect, this is because I used BigDecimal which does computations using many many decimals, so you might see some rounding errors, they especially become apparent for large values I'm really sorry for this, I tried my best
